Experts pointed out that the yuan, even more than the Japanese yen, has become used in carry trade strategies: chinese exporters hold large sums in dollars and companies are reluctant to convert those funds due to higher rates in the US. However, exporters may soon do so as the Fed prepares to cut rates — which could cause big moves in markets, the expert said.\n",

Japan and China also have different economic problems. While the yen's weakness was due to low interest rates in Japan, the yuan's weakness was mainly due to structural economic factors and serious geopolitical threats. China's economy has not fully recovered since the country emerged from nearly three years of COVID-19 restrictions, so it is more likely that the People's Bank of China will still need to cut rates.\n",
